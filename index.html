(1) the compton-thin covering factor $c_{22}$ of hi and hii is independent of the eddington ratio and is approximately $70\%$, while $c_{22}$ of hi alone is also independent of the eddington ratio and is approximately $30\%$. (2) the compton-thick covering factor $c_{24}$ of hi has the same value as $c_{22}$ of hi. (3) our $c_{24}$ is consistent with that obtained from x-ray observations. (4) our $c_{22}$ agrees with that obtained from x-ray observations in a high eddington ratio, while our $c_{22}$ is smaller than that from x-ray observations in a low eddington ratio. (5) to explain the difference between $c_{22}$ obtained from theoretical calculations and that inferred from x-ray observations, a compton-thin gas is required in regions extending at least $10~\mathrm{pc}$ beyond the current computational regions.">
